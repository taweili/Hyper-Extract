# Methods

Guide to extraction algorithms and when to use each.

---

## Overview

Methods are the underlying algorithms that extract knowledge from text. They determine:
- How text is processed
- How entities and relations are identified
- The quality and style of extraction

---

## Method Categories

### RAG-Based Methods

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation** combines information retrieval with text generation.

**Best for**: Large documents, complex queries

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Document] --> B[Chunk & Index]
    B --> C[Retrieve Relevant]
    C --> D[Generate Answer]
    D --> E[Extract Structure]
```

### Typical Methods

**Direct extraction** without retrieval.

**Best for**: Smaller documents, direct extraction

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Document] --> B[LLM Processing]
    B --> C[Extract Structure]
```
